# Configure desktop notifications

You can receive desktop notifications for messages sent while Zulip is
offscreen.

## Stream messages

To add desktop notifications for a single stream, follow the instructions
[here](/help/set-notifications-for-a-single-stream).

You can also add desktop notifications for all your current streams, or set
a default configuration for streams you join in the future.

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Under **Stream Messages**, select **Visual desktop notifications** and/or
**Audible desktop notifications**.

1. Under **Apply this change to all current stream subscriptions**, select
"yes" to start receiving desktop notifications for streams that you are
currently subscribed to. Note that this change will apply to all streams even if you
previously set notification preferences for individual streams. Select "no"
if you only want to apply your setting to streams that you subscribe to in
the future.
